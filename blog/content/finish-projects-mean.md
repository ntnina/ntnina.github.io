# Finishing projects
A collection of my thoughts on finishing projects.

It's raw and unfiltered. I'm not writing a book, I'm writing a stream of conciousness for *me* to come back to (to write a book, lol).

Jokes aside, this isn't meant to be coherent. If it sounds like I'm repeating myself it's because I've thought the same thing... Rather uhhh, the "repetition draws attention to its importance". Yeah. That works. See, I'm actually a genius writer! 

## DISCLAIMER
My writing style is fatalistic and imperative. I was brought up on a harsh English sense of humour.

At times it may seem like I'm being harsh. And, if you're of a certain disposition, you might view that not as the "joke with an underlying point" that it is meant to be, and instead as *literal*. In these moments stop, reframe what I'm saying, and continue. Or just ***go away and never come back***. 

This isn't a collection of profound truths, it's a collection of mad ramblings! 

The only solace you'll get is that one day I'll be bored enough to compile these thoughts into something coherent with **no jokes** and it'll be **unfunny, dry, and it'll make me Â£15.99 richer after you buy it on Amazon**.

## Small goals, winnable games
Your brain likes winning. Give it something to win at rather than some vague end-goal. Give it journeys, not destinations.

### Keep scopes small
A small project is a winnable project. Keeping your scope **well defined** and **small** increases the chance of you finishing your project. There is a visible and clear end in sight.

"I want to write complicated projects!"

Your small projects will turn into complicated projects. After you've finished the small scope, then the scope can increase. And, it probably will. It is very likely that whatever problem your small-scope program solves can be easily increased to solve a wider-case of problems. And because it can be *easily* increased, that in itself becomes a **winnable game**.

### Keep goals small
Don't look at your project as a single thing. It's a series of small goals that get you to the end.

Never write on a todo list or calendar "write project" or "work on project". Write goals that are **well defined** and **small** - goals that are **winnable**. Each small goal is a step. You writing your project will never complete it, but you completing small steps will.

### Keep goals *smaller* - decompose
Not in the bedrotting sense. If you're working on a project it's likely you've already decomposed "the project" into multiple separate problems.

Do this for your checklists/todos/calendars. 

If your goals on your todos keep routinely not getting done. **Define them better**.

I add sub-goals. `[ ] Read book` wasn't working, so `[ ] Read section A` worked... but then it stopped. So `[ ] Read section A -> [ ] Part one [ ] Part two` got written instead. If I'm feeling demotivated then you bet that `[ ] read paragraph 1` gets written. Recomposing goals (so, going backwards in this process) is also important to do - I won't write `read paragraph 1` every day, only on days where I'm demotivated

Make your **well defined** and **small** goals **inviting** to do.

Even a well defined small goal could be non-inviting (`Read section A` is a commitment, `Read section A part 1` is an ease)

### Keep the use of goals small
Sometimes it doesn't make sense to use goals. You should give your brain a **winnable game** that is non-goal-related.

Streaks are great for this. Keep a tally of successful days. Your brain loves a useless number.

This isn't meant to motivate you to do the whole damn day. It's just meant to make those *almost* moments happen. *Almost finished, but about to give up* into finished. *Almost gonna start but about to get distracted* into starting.

### Keep the amount of goals small
Don't drown yourself in goals. Even if they are **small** that is no excuse to have loads of them. If you find yourself regularly not being able to finish all goals in a day then maybe reconsider how many you give yourself.

Having less goals in total makes actually addressing a single one more inviting.

### Keep time between goals small
Your brain likes winning. Even better, your brain likes winning *a lot* and *very often*.

Try and make goals that facilitate this. Small, almost-instant things, that you can use during a bigger goal to give your brain a small win.

Start the day with a goal being complete. Start sitting at your desk with a goal being complete.

Small errands are perfect for this. "Check emails", "update status", "open editor", etc.

### Keep goals recent
Don't plan out days in advance. I know, it's tempting. You think of something on a busy day that you have to do and you instinctively write it on "tomorrow's sheet". Then "tomorrow's" sheet becomes "in 5 days's sheet" because you have planned *that far ahead*.

The truth is a meteor could fly onto your house tomorrow and "5 days's sheet" will never get completed. The time you spent planning it was time you *didn't* spend on your project.

And it creates a physical gap between you writing (opting into a promise to do something) and you doing (actually fulfilling the promise). 

If you borrow 5 quid (dollars, yen, ugandan shillings, etc.)  from a friend *today* and promised to pay them back *today*, you feel obliged to.

If you borrow 5 quid (bells, nook miles, etc.) from a friend *today* and promised to pay them back "at some point", and a year had passed... well "it's small enough to forget".

You aren't going to forget your goals. Write them in the morning or the night before (maybe that in itself is a goal).

Having lists of things you need to do and when is good, but writing them in the **small** and **well defined** goal format should happen **the day you intend to do that goal**.

### Give yourself a damn treat
You completed a day, or a hard goal. Or you just got out of bed. 

Give yourself a damn treat. A piece of chocolate, a warm drink, favourite blanket, or (as a good friend of mine proposed) "boing-yoing-yoing sound effect".

Pavlov yourself into those boings being ***addictive***. 




## Frictionless environment
Every obstacle is another excuse not to do something. Sometimes it isn't about how you *plan to do something* but rather *where you do something*. 

Make your environment **frictionless**, starting something shouldn't take thought.

### Keep organised
Messy environments are friction. It's harder to work on a project if you have multiple tabs about that project open, all in different places, some bookmarked in random folders. Even research becomes a *messy* and *complicated* process.

Do what you can to avoid friction:
- [ ] Move unfinished/dead/stale projects to their own folder, for a "rainy day"
- [ ] Put active projects in clearly defined folders, don't nest projects within other project folders, don't have parts of one project in another project - each project folder should be self-contained
- [ ] Close tabs related to projects in your browser after you're finished with them - if you haven't touched a tab in a month, put it in a text file in the project folder and close the tab

There is such a thing as being over-organised. If you have too many folders-in-folders, or store programming tabs on a separate browser, different things in different emails... All of this adds clicks. More clicks = more friction. So strike a balance between frictionless organisation without adding friction by over-organising.

### Momentum
Don't stop. A car that is moving has friction, but not nearly as much as one trying to start moving.

Stopping requires you to start again. That doesn't just mean finding the *motivation* and *momentum* again, but oftentimes also entails *relearning* things you've forgotten. No matter how you look at it, stopping is loss of progress.

So **slow down** if you feel like you need a break. We all have those days. Maybe you need a week. But that doesn't mean you stop. Make a **clear** and **well defined** plan - "I'll work on a single, small feature". Or work on a side-feature to work on. Or just do some reading on a topic related to the project. Just **don't stop**.

Smaller steps everyday are still steps. But making even smaller steps after a week of laying down? That's hard.

### Keep healthy
Illness is friction. Hunger and thirst are friction. Feeling tired is friction.

While this point isn't entirely in your control, try and make your environment as accommodating as possible. Try to sleep well, keep water and food close. Watch what you eat - make sure you're eating balanced.

Buy a better pillow and keep a water bottle close by, your project will thank you for it.

(My kryptonite here is caffeine. I am saturated with coffee and very quickly slip into habitually drinking cups and cups of it. Especially when working on projects, where I like the adding feeling of focus. And *especially when it tastes so good*).

### Keep mentally healthy
Failing to listen to yourself is friction. Listen to yourself. What is she telling you? 

Is she feeling tired and overworked? Give yourself a slower day or re-evaluate how many goals you've given yourself. 

Is she feeling like she isn't living up to your potential? Find one more thing to do that day, even if it's just planning a part of your project out.

Is she feeling like she could do **more**? Crack on.

(she as in a way to refer to a ship... unless you go by she/her... then I just guessed very well :3) 

### Set your expectations
Demotivation is the biggest and most general "friction". Setting your expectations high is a fast-track to demotivation.

Expect pain. Expect a bug to take days to complete. Expect the "simplest" part of the project to have *something* to trip you up. 

And, most of all, expect nothing from your projects. No fame, no money. 

Your project won't be starred on Github, downloaded on itch/npm/pypi/whateverthehellyoureusing. You're writing this project because the joy you get out of it is greater than all of that anyway. 

Plus, if all of your projects were *that* well received, you'd be crushed under the weight of maintaining them. 

### Set your expectations pt.2 
Last one was quite sad, but for a hopeful take.

Expect things to be difficult. And remind yourself that what you're doing is difficult. 

It's okay to take longer than expected, it's okay for it to not be as polished as you'd hoped. Writing code is hard.

"But someone else can write my project in a day!" 

You aren't them and you never will be, you can only accept that you are who you are now - but that person is malleable. You can't become that person but you can certainly reach their level.

You'll also have your own skills. Focus on them.

(An example - I can code a game, but most of my game projects have burned and died. Why? Because I haven't learned to draw yet - I've never been interested. If you can draw, then you already have a skill that makes you a better project creator than me... maybe we should colla-)




## Effort can sometimes equate to importance
A lot of focus is put on "more efficiency". But if things are more efficient, more automated, more effortless - it often means your investment mimics the initial effort.

There's a time and place for more efficiency, but *less efficient, more effort* is a tool you can use to *invest yourself*.

### Physical writing
I've noticed in my friends that the ones that study the hardest always hand write notes, todo lists, calendars, plans, etc.

I'm a computer scientist, so I've always looked down on these "primitive methods". But after I felt how satisfying it was to check a box... I have to say. **You're more invested in what you physically write out**.

It takes me 5 minutes to write a markdown todo list, or a excel sheet calendar. It takes me double the time to write these things on paper, but that often means I'm *doubly as invested* to do that anyway.

### Filter what you don't want to do
If you can't be bothered to write a todo list for something, consider that **you aren't invested enough in it anyway**. 

If you aren't invested, don't waste your time, **give up**.

You can use that time and effort somewhere where you are invested - **give up** this thing to **take up** another.

And maybe, one day, you'll come back to what you gave up. 

Many people are too addicted to the idea of *finishing* a project. You need to be addicted to the idea of *working* on a project.

### Treat your project with respect
You can slap out a project quickly. Sloppy code, no comments and botch-fixes to bugs. Many projects become held together with tape and glue.

Put the effort and investment in to make some cement for those issues. A botch fix now should be a future "look into". 

This holds tenfold for long-term projects. It's okay to not make any progress for a day, even a week, and spend that whole time just planning or mopping up code. Making the project clearer both literally and metaphorically. Because **you're actually still making progress when doing that**. And, making future progress is less **friction**.
