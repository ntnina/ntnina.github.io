In recent years I’ve noticed that the internet has become a different place. While a change in internet culture is to be expected – as it isn’t unlike a change in real life culture – I believe this change in internet culture isn’t caused by an "organic" reason. This isn’t simply people changing. It’s a shift in how we use the internet as a whole and our consumption of media.

The use of the internet has changed drastically. In years past the internet acted as a haven for sharing information and culture. People would set up their own personal websites, and link to other people’s personal websites. This created a "web" of sites linking to sites. Forums were focused on discussion surrounding a particular topic.

But hosting costs are expensive. Websites built around the idea of hosting your content on their platform became appealing to those who could not afford hosting costs. Why host videos on a server when YouTube exists? Why host blogs on a server when Tumblr exists? Why host disjointed and unwarranted political opinions on a server when Twitter exists?

It was perfect, sharing content was free. But it came at a cost.

The first, and most obvious, was the cost of our privacy. Now singular entities controlled vast amounts of data. We started to be tracked, and our data used for profit. Then the protection of our data become monetized as well – since we can just "pay to get our privacy back". <span class="spoiler">"Sponsored by ****VPN"</span>

The second, and less obvious, was that it became harder to separate content. Educated and uneducated opinions, truth and lie, fact and fiction, they all mixed. As these sites became more focused on gaining and trapping users in a barrage of content there was a clear shift in what worked. The credible and fact-checked video is less likely to get recommended over the loud clickbait video because the clickbait video retains viewers.

The final, and almost never talked about cost was the web is no longer a "web". When people “use the internet” now, they mean "I log onto the same 5 websites, scroll in an algorithm-created echo chamber for a few hours, and then log off – usually mad enough to feel both pissed off and somehow invested enough to log back on tomorrow". We oftentimes use services just because our friends/peers use it – I’ve spoken to many people who <em>hate</em> Snapchat, but are very active on it because their friends use it. 

For me, my awakening to this was coming from the Japanese internet back to the English internet. The internet culture in Japan isn’t <em>that</em> different. Overall I feel it’s more respectful. But I tend to watch videos that are 15+ years old, so I have effectively been living in 2010 for quite some time.

When I came back to the English internet I saw an obsession with drama. There are channels dedicated to documenting the “downfall” of people. I feel alienated because my real life peers sometimes see this content and act as if it is another day. Have we grown so blind as to not see how disgusting it is to profit off the misfortune of others? <span class="spoiler">Even if "they deserve it" – that’s the reaction that benefits the people profiting off this type of content! And I think that’s a poor excuse.</span>

Similarly I see a lot of discussion on identity. Most of it, nowadays, is quite healthy (certainly different from when I was around). But there is still an "us vs them" attitude to a lot of it. Although I can’t say I’m shocked, because most social media sites create echo chambers that cultivate this kind of culture. If you see post after post of "x" type of person doing triggering things then that’s going to form a certain opinion of all of "them types" of people (but, more importantly, you’ll click on the post and engage with it, maybe watch another ad or two). 

People have lost the ability to forgive others. It feels as if every individual is their own PR team. And a single fuck up spells certain doom, as it will be the only thing you are ever remembered for. That’s just not how humans work though – we change. It is possible for someone to completely turn around in a very short amount of time. But forgiveness doesn’t drive a strong reaction in the viewer, it doesn’t cause them to click.

Sites like tiktok take this a step further. No longer do you search and subscribe to creators, you just get shown what it thinks you want. And, sadly, most of the time it’s right. 

But what you want isn't what you <em>need</em>. Our mental health is slipping as a society because we have a 24/7 non-stop stream of negativity thinly veiled as "content". Our old internet is still alive! It has aged, maybe, but it’s still breathing and you can still use it.

I’m writing this for the person who is tired of the drama, of the arguments, of looking at social media and walking away angry enough to click but not angry enough to uninstall.

Consider an internet where you can learn new things. Walk away satisfied, and happy. Have the urge to return not be out of anger or frustration but out of genuine curiosity.

<h2>Step 0. Opening your mind</h2>

The modern internet practically forces you to take a stance on everything. Learn that it is okay to be impartial or to not care about topics. You don’t have to form an opinion and most of the time it serves you well not to.

The modern internet also makes it laughably easy to get put in echo chambers. As a result, we tend to think our opinions are “just common sense” and that the people who disagree with us are “delusional”. 

If you take this short guide seriously you probably will be met with the opposite opinion to topics – and the authors will probably be people who are quite well read and articulate. Don’t view seeing an opposing opinion as an attack, but try and reframe it as a “test”. You’re just testing whether your opinion holds up against the other opinion. The other person isn’t delusional in the same way that you aren’t all-knowing. If your opinion holds up against the test then it’s more likely to be correct, but if it doesn’t then it’s okay to change your opinion to match more factual data.

<h2>Step 1. Clearing the modern services</h2>

Only use services that let you control the content you see. No tiktok, no reels. 100% no News or News-like outlets (they are the OGs of profiting off misfortune, and mostly biased - if you must have news then try and evaluate how biased it is and perhaps get multiple sources for each topic).

Use modes in apps that show you subscription/follow only feeds, so that you can filter the content you see. You shouldn’t have to blacklist content you don’t want to see – but whitelist content you do want to see.

Turn down the noise. Go into the notification settings and only allow notifications for when a friend has messaged you. So many apps draw you in with "this person has posted", "we think you might like this", "you haven’t checked in with us for a few days". It’s all to draw you back into that loop of angry scroll scroll scrolling. 

Some apps might go as far as to send you emails. They’re desperate but you have the power to say no.

As mentioned before, you might use a service because your friends use it. These can be harder to "clear" because your social group is the one calling you back to the service. I have a friend who uses Instagram to speak to friends and they end up spending a lot of time doomscrolling reels. They can’t get rid of the app because their friends don’t use another app. 

In these situations it’s important to step back and just confirm that it is genuinely 100% necessary for you to speak on those platforms. A messaging service usually comes with less distractions, and if you can move your friends onto one I would recommend doing so. If it is 100% necessary then you need to look into ways to make accessing anything other than messages infuriating. (Some operating systems might let you set "app lock" timers that you have to manually extend if you want to use the app for longer – for tech savvy people you can leverage your knowledge to write extensions for websites that just flat out get rid of the bad stuff).


<h2>Step 2. Stepping into the ancient craft of web surfing</h2>

We tend to focus our internet use on a handful of websites. But, usually when you google something multiple websites come up, not just 3. We’re going to be looking at these other sites.

It boils down to this.

<ol>
    <li>Google something</li>
    <li>Click a link that interests you (similar to picking a YouTube video)</li>
    <li>Evaluate whether the website is interesting to you, if it is then continue but if it isn’t then go back to (2.)</li>
    <li>If it’s something you’ll want to routinely visit, bookmark it. Mobile devices also let you save site bookmarks to the home screen. If it is popular enough to have an app, maybe download it.</li>
    <li>If it’s something that you’ll want to be updated on, but not necessarily routinely visit (e.g. when someone “posts”, or updates the page content) then we’ll cover that in the next section...</li>
    <li>Go back to (2.)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Step 3. RSS. The multitool for reclaimers.</h2>

Setting up an RSS reader is important. You know how social media sites will occasionally give you notifications to try and get you back on the site? RSS is that, except you control what content you get notified about.

In simple terms, it’s a "follow with notifications" feature for entire websites. Whenever the content of the feed updates, you will get a notification.

Many blogs will make use of RSS (or a similar thing called Atom) in order for users to be notified when there is a new post.

Some services may offer an RSS feed, which oftentimes is very reliable. YouTube supports it for individual channels (although you have to dig through the page source code to find it) and some news websites support it. 

You can start growing your little collection of subscribed feeds :) 

<h2>Step 4. Sites dedicated to finding sites</h2>
Sometimes finding the content can be difficult. Google doesn't always show the best blogs first - because the best blogs are independent creators who haven't optimised their site for SEO. So, you might have to look elsewhere. Here are some ideas:

<ul>
    <li>Hacker news and other “congregation of information” sites (mainly for CS nerds)</li>
    <li>Reddit (be careful! Join communities focused more on sharing independent links rather than getting trapped inside of Reddit!)</li>
    <li>Independent bulletin boards, irc, telnet, etc.</li>
    <li>Blogs usually link to other blogs! Many personal blogs will have “friends” links, and some blogs may even have a dedicated section to sharing interesting links. You may also find interesting links inside posts.</li>
    <li>Webring and badges - a dying format but still valid</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 5. A note on Archive.org</h2>

Blogs get deleted. If you find something cool that you think you’ll want to read again – instead of just bookmarking it, I would recommend using an archive site like archive.org or archive.ph.

This not only ensures that you still get to read the content if it is taken down, but also that other people can read the content if it is taken down.

<h2>Step 6. Forgiveness – remembering that your fellow users are human too</h2>

This is all the way down here because it is, in my opinion, the hardest for people accustomed to the modern internet to do. I would like to believe that the majority of people do not need to hear this, but

Find it in yourself to forgive. By feeding into the hate you have for someone, or a group of people, you aren't being "righteous" or "upholding your values". You're stagnating. They will be forced to move on, and while they do you'll be sat there in your chair staying still. They will grow, you won't. By forgiving and forgetting not only will you help in this fight. But you'll grow alongside the people you're forgiving. This goes doubly so for "moral high grounds". A telltale sign of social media echo chambering.

It is okay for someone to do something wrong and learn from it. Equally it is okay for someone to do something that you consider wrong, and then successfully convince you with sound justification that what they did was right. 

Consider that people change, even in a very short span of time.


<h2>Thanks for reading</h2>

This post was a little disjointed, and I will admit this is kind of aimed at very particular groups of people on the internet. There are people who can use modern services and filter bullshit-algorithm-ragebait and echo chambers from what makes them happy. And they are stronger for it, they can leverage the vast range of content on the modern internet without being sucked into algorithm hell. (One example of this is a friend of mine who uses YouTube exclusively through RSS – so she only sees the content that she wants to see, and she’s mature enough to only watch content that is intellectually engaging without being controversial).

So this post might come across as more "everyone must do this now" when I actually intended it to be more like "if you’re susceptible to the algorithm, do this". But nevermind, it’s time for some shameless self promotion:

My blog now has an RSS feed. If you subscribe the RSS feed then you get notified whenever I make a post. 

I also have a "links" section – where I will link to other blogs :). This won't have an RSS feed but should be updated whenever I find stuff that interests me.

If you feel inspired from this post to make the internet work for you, rather than you working for it, then please check both of these out.
